                <strong>1: Land Selection and Preparation</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Before any construction begins, you must choose the right plot.
                Factors like location, soil quality, road access, water
                connection, drainage, and legal clearances play a vital role. In
                Bangalore, areas like Sarjapur, Whitefield, Devanahalli, and
                Electronic City are popular among homebuyers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you've finalized the land, the site must be cleared and
                leveled. This step involves removing rocks, trees, debris, or
                old structures. Then, the land is surveyed to mark property
                boundaries and set levels.
              </p>

                <strong>2: Planning and Approvals</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                This is the design phase, where your vision begins to take
                shape. Working with an architect, you&rsquo;ll create floor
                plans, elevations, and 3D drawings of your future home.
              </p>
              <p>
                After that, the plans must be submitted to the Bangalore
                Development Authority (BDA), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike
                (BBMP), or the local panchayat, depending on where your land is
                located.

                <strong>3: Excavation and Foundation</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Once approvals are in place, actual construction begins with
                excavation. This involves digging trenches where the foundation
                will be laid. The depth and type of foundation depend on the
                soil test results and the design of your home.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Bangalore, where clayey and red soil is common, proper
                drainage planning is also crucial.

                <strong>4: Plinth Beam and Ground Floor Slab</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                After the foundation sets, a plinth beam is constructed to
                distribute the load and connect all foundation columns. Then,
                the ground floor slab is poured.
              </p>
              <p>
                This marks the base of your house structure and gives the first
                glimpse of your home&rsquo;s footprint.

              </h4>
              <p>
                This stage brings your home to life. The vertical columns,
                horizontal beams, and brick walls are built as per the floor
                plan. Reinforced cement concrete (RCC) is typically used for
                strength and durability.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Bangalore, weather conditions and labor availability can
                affect this stage, so timelines should be managed accordingly.

              </h4>

                Once the walls are complete, the roof slab is laid. This stage
                also includes building staircases and parapet walls for safety.

                After the structure is complete, external walls are finished
                with brickwork or concrete blocks. External plastering helps
                weatherproof your home and gives it a neat appearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is also the time to start enclosing the space and preparing

                Once the outer shell is complete, the inside of the home starts
                taking shape. Internal plaster is applied to even out surfaces.
                Then, flooring work begins &mdash; including tiling, granite,
                marble, or other finishes.

                Waterproofing is essential in areas like bathrooms, terraces,

                While interior work wraps up, the exterior also gets attention.
                This includes compound walls, gates, garden areas, and exterior

              <p>
                Before moving in, a final inspection ensures everything is done
                as planned. You should walk through the house and check each
                element &mdash; from wall finishes to electrical points,
                plumbing lines, window locks, and drainage.
              </p>
              <p>
                After this, the keys are handed over, and you&rsquo;re ready to
