                            <ol>

                                    <h6>Ignoring the Scale and Proportion of Furniture</h6>
                                    <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                    <p>One of the most common mistakes in interior design is ignoring the scale and proportion of furniture. Oversized furniture can make a room feel cramped, while too-small pieces can leave the space feeling sparse and unfinished.</p>
                                    <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                    <p>Before purchasing furniture, measure your space and consider the proportions. Use a floor plan or online design tool to visualize how different pieces will fit in the room. Choose furniture that complements the room's size and layout, ensuring that each piece has enough breathing room.</p>                                  
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <h6>Overcrowding the Space</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Filling a room with too much furniture, décor, or accessories can create a cluttered and overwhelming environment. This can make it difficult to move around and enjoy the space.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Embrace the concept of "less is more." Focus on a few key pieces of furniture and carefully select décor items that enhance the room's overall design. Leave plenty of open space to allow for easy movement and to give the room a more open and airy feel.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <h6>Neglecting Lighting</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Poor lighting can drastically affect the mood and functionality of a space. Relying solely on overhead lighting or not considering the natural light can lead to a room that feels flat and uninviting.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Layer your lighting by incorporating ambient, task, and accent lighting. Use a combination of overhead lights, floor lamps, table lamps, and wall sconces to create a well-lit and versatile space. Don’t forget to take advantage of natural light by using sheer curtains or strategically placing mirrors to reflect light throughout the room.</p>

                                <h6>Choosing Paint Colors Before Furniture</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Selecting paint colors before choosing furniture and décor can limit your options and make it difficult to create a cohesive design. The wrong color can clash with your furnishings or create a mood that doesn’t align with your vision.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Start with your key furniture pieces and décor items, then choose a paint color that complements them. This approach allows you to create a harmonious color palette that ties the room together.</p>

                                <li>
                                <h6>Ignoring the Focal Point</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Every room needs a focal point, whether it’s a piece of art, a fireplace, or a beautiful view. Without a focal point, a room can feel directionless and lack visual interest.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Identify a focal point in each room and design around it. Arrange furniture and décor to draw attention to this feature, ensuring it stands out as the centerpiece of the space.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <h6> Misplacing Area Rugs</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Area rugs that are too small or incorrectly placed can disrupt the flow of a room and make the space feel disjointed.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Choose an area rug that is large enough to fit under all the main furniture pieces in a room. In a living room, for example, the rug should extend under the front legs of sofas and chairs. This helps to anchor the furniture and create a more cohesive look.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                <h6>Overlooking Functionality</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Focusing solely on aesthetics without considering functionality can lead to a space that looks great but doesn’t meet your needs.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Think about how you use each room and select furniture and décor that serve a purpose. For example, in a living room, ensure there’s enough seating for guests and that the layout allows for easy conversation. House Construct excels in creating spaces that are both beautiful and practical, ensuring that your home meets all your functional requirements.</p>

                                <h6>Clashing Color Schemes</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Using too many colors or selecting colors that don’t complement each other can create a chaotic and unbalanced look.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Stick to a cohesive color palette with 2-3 main colors and a few accent hues. Use these colors consistently throughout the space to create harmony. If you’re unsure about color choices, consider using a color wheel or consulting a design professional for advice.</p>

                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Following design trends without considering your personal style can result in a space that doesn’t feel like home.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Incorporate elements that reflect your personality and taste. Whether it’s through artwork, family heirlooms, or unique décor items, make sure your space feels personal and comfortable. House Construct understands the importance of personalized design, ensuring that your home is a true reflection of your individual style.</p>

                                <h6>Not Testing Paint Colors</h6>
                                <h6>Mistake:</h6>
                                <p>Choosing a paint color without testing it in your space can lead to surprises once it’s on the walls. Lighting, furniture, and even the size of the room can affect how a color looks.</p>
                                <h6>How to Avoid:</h6>
                                <p>Always test paint colors on the walls before committing. Paint small swatches in different areas of the room and observe them at different times of day. This will help you choose a color that works well with the room’s lighting and furnishings.</p>
