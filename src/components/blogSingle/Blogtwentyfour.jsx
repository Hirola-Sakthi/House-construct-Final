                  Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Builder in Bangalore
                </strong>
              </h2>
              <h4>
                <strong>
                  1. Not Researching the Builder&rsquo;s Track Record
                </strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                One of the most common mistakes is not doing enough background
                checks. Many homebuyers rely on flashy advertisements or website
                promises instead of looking into the builder&rsquo;s actual
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What to do instead:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Visit ongoing or completed projects.
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Talk to past clients about their experience.
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check online reviews from real customers.
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Look for consistency in construction quality and on-time
                  delivery.
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>A builder's portfolio speaks louder than words.</p>
              <h4>
                <strong>2. Ignoring Legal Approvals and Documentation</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                In Bangalore, legal paperwork and project approvals are a big
                deal. Some builders may cut corners or start work without
                securing all necessary approvals from BBMP, BDA, RERA, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Why this matters:
                  <br />{" "}
                </strong>
                &nbsp;If the builder lacks proper permissions, your home could
                face legal complications or even demolition notices.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Always ask for:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Land title deeds
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  RERA registration
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Approved building plans
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  NOCs from local authorities
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Without these, you risk investing in an illegal or disputed
                property.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>3. Falling for Unrealistic Pricing</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                &ldquo;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&rdquo;
                Builders offering unusually low prices often make up for it with
                subpar materials, hidden costs, or delayed timelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Instead, look for:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Transparent pricing with clear cost breakups
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Material quality specifications
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inclusions and exclusions listed in the quotation
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A good builder doesn&rsquo;t cut corners&mdash;especially when
                it comes to your safety and long-term investment.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>4. Not Clarifying the Scope of Work</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Many homebuyers make verbal agreements and later realize key
                services or materials weren&rsquo;t included. For example,
                electrical fittings, flooring upgrades, or kitchen cabinets
                might be &ldquo;extra.&rdquo;
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Avoid this mistake by:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Getting everything in writing
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Asking for a detailed BoQ (Bill of Quantities)
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reviewing the agreement thoroughly before signing
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A transparent scope of work builds trust between you and your
                builder.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>5. Overlooking Material Specifications</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                The brand and quality of materials used in your
                home&mdash;cement, steel, tiles, paint&mdash;have a long-term
                impact on durability, safety, and aesthetics.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  Don&rsquo;t just ask &ldquo;Which brand?&rdquo;&mdash;also
                  ask:
                </strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  What grade of cement/steel will be used?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Is the tile anti-skid or regular?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  What kind of waterproofing is included?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Your builder should be open and honest about materials. If they
                hesitate to provide this info, consider it a red flag.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>6. Skipping the Construction Timeline Details</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Timely completion is one of the biggest stress points for
                homeowners. Without clear timelines, the project can drag on for
                months or even years.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>To avoid delays, ensure your contract includes:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A realistic start and end date
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Milestone-based schedule
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Penalties for delay (if applicable)
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Some delays may be unavoidable, but a reliable builder will keep
                you updated at every stage.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>7. Not Understanding Payment Terms</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Many buyers end up in disputes because they agreed to vague or
                unfavorable payment terms. For instance, some builders may
                demand a large upfront payment and delay the work later.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The right approach is:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Milestone-based payments (e.g., after foundation, roofing,
                  plastering, etc.)
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoid large advances before work begins
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clarity on taxes, additional charges, and final payments
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Always read the fine print and ask questions if anything is
                unclear.
              </p>
              <h4>
                <strong>8. Ignoring Warranty or Post-Handover Support</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                A good builder doesn&rsquo;t disappear after handing over your
                home. Construction issues like seepage, tile cracks, or
                electrical problems often come up within the first year.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Check for:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Written warranty for structure, plumbing, electrical work
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Timeline and process for resolving complaints
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whether AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) is available
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>You deserve peace of mind even after you move in.</p>

                <strong>
                  9. Choosing Builders Without On-Site Supervision
                </strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Some builders outsource labor or construction without proper
                on-site supervision, which leads to errors, rework, or safety
                issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Ask these questions before signing:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Who supervises the site daily?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  How frequently will quality checks happen?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
                <li>
                  Will I receive photo/video updates?
                  <br />{" "}
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Professional builders have engineers and project managers
                visiting regularly to ensure work is on track and as promised.
              </p>

                  10. Not Evaluating Communication and Transparency
                </strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Good builders don&rsquo;t just build&mdash;they communicate.
                Lack of timely updates, poor coordination, or evasive responses
                can lead to misunderstandings and stress.

                professional and unregulated.
